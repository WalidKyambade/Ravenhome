ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This is a game where you buy and sell items to customers that come into your shop.
The game is designed so that ideally you wouldn't have to look at any instructions
and the player would be able to pick up how the game works intuitivley and understand
how it works. Some instruction for various upgrades are given in the menu.
The game also uses characters that are not on the basic ASCII table. It worked in the 
code server but I am unsure if it will work in the local install.
