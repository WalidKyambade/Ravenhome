You are Blake Silver of RavenHome, a small shop at the end of 
Delderoth Bay. Times are tough, and they've only gotten tougher 
since the Dark War. Strange folk walk the streets. They move 
with their faces covered and cloaks drawn. And far adventurers 
come now to Ravenhome to sell whatever dark, mystical things 
come out of the east. Strange items, artifacts, odd trinkets, 
jewels. Magic even? Stay quiet. One need not know what comes 
in and out of Ravenhome nowadays. Just buy, sell, and move on. 
You donâ€™t want any trouble. It's bad enough that these dark 
items are making their way through Ravenhome, gods know what 
would actually happen if you actually USED one. . .

And to make things worse, somebody broke into your shop the 
other day and ran you clean. They took almost everyting. 
All they've left is the five items under the register and 
65 gold to your name. The shop was utterly destroyed as well, 
paintings and candles are smashed on the floor. Recluctantly,  
you flip the sign out front to open and hobble back to the 
register. 'it'll be another long day in Delderoth I suppose'
